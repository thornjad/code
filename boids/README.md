# A simple boids program

A simple 2D boids program using pygame, just to explore swarm intelligence. This program draws heavily on a 2D derivation of the classical boid characteristics as presented by Craig W Reynolds in  _Flocks, Herds, and Schools: A Distributed Behavioral Model_ (doi:10.1145/37402.37406).
