In one of my early classes at the University of Minnesota, an assignment challenged me to create a rough simulation of Minneapolis's light rail system, with the goal of determining the effectiveness of lengthening trains (between one and three cars) vs running trains more frequently. I did okay on this project, but I never got it running well enough to convincingly determine which service change provides greater ridership. For some reason, this simulation project has stuck with me. This program attempts to revisit it to provide some myself with some _closure_ and some fun.
