# Goals

makecoffee aims to make these improvements over js2coffee:

- __Use modern Coffeescript and Javascript__<br>
  Most ES6+ features throw errors from js2coffee. These should be fully supported.

- __Cleaner repository__<br>
  js2coffee should be cleaned up, modernized and ready for a brave new world.

- __Secure__<br>
  makecoffee will be kept up-to-date with security fixes from npm and Snyk

- __Smaller__<br>
  makecoffee strives to be smaller and have less dependencies than js2coffee, while providing better compilation.

- __Better error messages__<br>
  Helping users pin down what went wrong.
