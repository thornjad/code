# Warbler

## Introduction

Warbler is a general purpose programming language, designed primarily as a pet language for small projects. It transcompiles to JavaScript with execution in Node.js in mind. Warbler is heavily influenced by Common Lisp, Coffeescript, Orson, Hot Cocoa Lisp, Fargo, and obviously JavaScript. Some further inspiration comes from the worlds of C, Tcl, Scheme and Clojure.

The name Warbler is not an acronym, and is named for the small avian insectivors.

### Overview

Warbler programs are comprised of _forms_ that are _evaluated_ to return other forms. Forms are expressions which evaluate without error (note that an exception is not an error).
